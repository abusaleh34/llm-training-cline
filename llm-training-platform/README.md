# LLM Training Platform

A privacy-focused on-premise platform for training and deploying AI agents using your organization's documents.

## Overview

The LLM Training Platform is designed to enable organizations to leverage their own documents to train and deploy AI agents while maintaining complete control over their data. The platform is built with privacy and security in mind, allowing for deployment in air-gapped environments.

## Key Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Upload and process various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) with OCR support for Arabic language.
- **Data Structuring**: Organize and structure extracted text for efficient retrieval and training.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tune large language models on your organization's data.
- **Agent Deployment**: Deploy interactive AI agents that can answer questions based on your documents.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens on-premise, ensuring your data never leaves your infrastructure.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices design allows for horizontal scaling to handle large document collections.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control for different platform features.
- **API Access**: Comprehensive API for integration with existing systems.

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific part of the workflow:

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests
- **Document Ingestion Service**: Handles document processing and text extraction
- **Data Structuring Service**: Organizes and structures the extracted text
- **Model Training Service**: Provides model training capabilities
- **Agent Deployment Service**: Handles the deployment of trained models

For more details, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/README.md).

## Getting Started

### Installation

The platform can be installed using Docker Compose (for development) or Kubernetes (for production).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/llm-training-platform.git
cd llm-training-platform

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start the services
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose up -d
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](docs/installation/README.md).

### Usage

Once installed, you can:

1. Upload documents through the API or Admin Dashboard
2. Monitor document processing status
3. Create datasets from processed documents
4. Train models on your datasets
5. Deploy interactive AI agents
6. Query agents with natural language questions

For detailed usage instructions, see the [Usage Guide](docs/usage/README.md).

### Testing
