# Staging Deployment Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the staging deployment and validation process for the LLM Training Platform.

## Overview

We've implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying the LLM Training Platform to a staging environment. This pipeline builds Docker images, runs tests, deploys the application to a temporary environment, and performs health checks to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Components Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow

We've created a GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml` that handles the entire deployment process. The workflow consists of the following jobs:

- **Prepare**: Sets up the deployment environment and creates necessary directories
- **Build**: Builds and pushes Docker images for all microservices
- **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests
- **Deploy**: Deploys the application to a staging environment
- **Cleanup**: Schedules cleanup of the staging environment after 72 hours

### 2. Docker Images

We've created Dockerfiles for all microservices:

- `Dockerfile.base`: Base image with common dependencies
- `Dockerfile.api_gateway`: API Gateway service
- `Dockerfile.document_ingestion`: Document Ingestion service
- `Dockerfile.data_structuring`: Data Structuring service
- `Dockerfile.model_training`: Model Training service
- `Dockerfile.agent_deployment`: Agent Deployment service
- `Dockerfile.admin_dashboard`: Admin Dashboard service

### 3. Staging Environment

The staging environment is deployed using Docker Compose with the following components:

- PostgreSQL database
- Milvus vector database (with Etcd and MinIO dependencies)
- All microservices
- Nginx reverse proxy with basic authentication

### 4. Health Checks

We've implemented health check endpoints in the API Gateway to verify the deployment:

- `/healthz`: Returns the health status of the application and its dependencies
- API endpoints: Verified with basic authentication

### 5. Demo Data

We've created a script (`src/scripts/seed_demo_data.py`) to seed the staging environment with demo data for testing purposes. This includes:

- Demo users (admin, manager, regular user)
- Sample documents
- Other necessary data for QA testing

### 6. Deployment Artifacts

The deployment process generates the following artifacts:

- Deployment log: Records all steps of the deployment process
- Deployment summary: Provides a concise summary of the deployment
- Docker images: Tagged with the Git commit SHA

## Security Considerations

The staging environment includes the following security measures:

- Basic authentication (username: qa, password: qa123) for accessing the application
- Encrypted environment variables for sensitive information
- Temporary URL valid for 72 hours

## Usage

The staging environment can be accessed using the provided URL and basic authentication credentials. The environment is automatically destroyed after 72 hours to prevent resource waste.

## Rollback Mechanism

If any step in the deployment process fails (tests, migrations, health checks), the environment is automatically rolled back and the error details are included in the deployment log.

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive smoke tests
- Implement performance testing
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
