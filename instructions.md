**Objective:**
Design and implement a full-featured, privacy-focused on-premise platform that allows organizations to train and deploy AI agents using their own data—specifically contracts, scanned documents, letters, and internal communications. The platform must support both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning techniques depending on the user’s needs.

**Project Scope (Phased Approach):**
*The work will be carried out in clearly defined stages. No phase should begin before the previous one is tested and explicitly approved.*

### **Phase 1: Document Ingestion & Preprocessing**

* Build a secure file upload interface that supports:

  * Scanned PDFs (image-based)
  * Searchable PDFs
  * TXT/DOCX file formats
* Integrate Arabic-optimized OCR (e.g., Tesseract with Arabic language support) to extract text from scanned PDFs.
* Apply pre-processing:

  * Noise reduction, deskewing, and enhancement (OpenCV)
  * OCR correction, normalization, tokenization (Arabic NLP libraries)

### **Phase 2: Data Structuring & Indexing**

* Store cleaned data in a structured format (e.g., JSON or a database like PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
* Implement chunking and metadata tagging to support both RAG and fine-tuning pipelines.
* Optional: Extract named entities, relations, and key clauses for enhanced semantic search.

### **Phase 3: Model Training & RAG Setup**

* Provide two pathways:

  1. **Fine-tuning:** Allow users to fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA, Falcon) on their own documents.
  2. **RAG:** Implement a retrieval-augmented generation setup with a vector store (e.g., FAISS, Qdrant) and embedding models.
* Include support for Arabic embeddings (e.g., BAAI/BGE, CAMeL, AraBERT).

### **Phase 4: Interactive AI Agent Deployment**

* Build a local chat interface or API where users can:

  * Ask natural language questions
  * Receive precise answers grounded in the uploaded documents
  * Optionally view source references or citation context
* Must work offline with no dependency on external services.

### **Phase 5: Admin Dashboard**

* Manage document uploads and model training sessions
* Review logs of AI interactions (anonymized for privacy)
* Monitor resource usage (CPU, GPU, disk, memory)
* Optionally allow re-training or model version management

### **Security & On-Prem Deployment:**

* The solution must be fully deployable in an isolated on-premise environment with:

  * No internet connectivity
  * Encryption at rest and in transit
  * User access roles and authentication controls

**Delivery Guidelines:**

* Use modular, containerized architecture (Docker, Kubernetes if needed)
* Include documentation for installation, usage, and maintenance
* Maintain codebase quality and clarity for future extensibility
